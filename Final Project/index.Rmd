In this large dataset provided by Expedia, I will be studying the relationship between number of customer reviews a hotel has and whether it's shown for a promotional offer. 

My intuition is that hotels with fewer customer reviews are more likely to be shown for promotional offers. Customer reviews are a signal of credibility and quality -- you're more likely to buy an item on Amazon at a higher price if there's plenty of customer reviews about the product. Hotels that don't have many customer reviews because they're relatively new, don't do a good job of soliciting customer reviews, etc. will receive less customer attention than hotels with many reviews. Thus, they may need to rely on strategies like promotional pricing to draw in customers, while hotels with lots of reviews can draw in customers through credibility.

**Hypothesis:**
The number of customer reviews a hotel is associated with how likely the hotel is to be shown for promotional offers.
